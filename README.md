## Cleaning
After activating your venv, in `src/`:

1. Install everything needed: `pip install -U black isort pre-commit pre-commit-hooks pylint`.
2. Activate `pre-commit`: `pre-commit install`.
   - You can also run `pre-commit` independently: `pre-commit run --all-files`.
3. Check the code: `pylint *.py`.
